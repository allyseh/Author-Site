               towards whatever Zo has only described as ‘tower’. With no other guide to go by, and with the constant threats of beasts, hunger, 
               and begin discovered by soldiers, Declan leads his bay in a search for safety.

             <h4 class="char-name">Secar</h4>
             <p class="char-details">Reports continue to flood in from northern battalions regarding the attack on Illengra. Rumors of soldiers 
               in glowing silver armour occupy Secar’s mind. With many of his forces wiped out or missing, he must grapple with how you fight a force 
               that kills the very ground it walks on, and how you lead a kingdom when you’re mad?

               they can only hope to arrive before the king is killed by this new enemy, or by his own court.
