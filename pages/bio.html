          <div class="about-me">
             <p class="bio-p">I’ve always enjoyed good stories, and grew up on fantasy, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, you get the general picture. 
                It wasn’t until college I realized it could be even more satisfying to tell a story. For me, that satisfaction came at parties and other
                group gatherings. It wasn’t until after I married my wife that writing became a focus in my life. She had grown up in a house that punished 
                children by removing their books, and that was effective punishment. She loves books, and always had dreams of writing. Between her dreams 
                and my ability to ramble into 30 minute tangents with story ideas, it would have been reprehensible if we hadn’t managed to publish a book.
             </p>
             <p class="bio-p">We have been blessed by the support of our fans from day 1, when we released our children's series Sunny and Starchy. 
                These are the adventures of a bright, happy sunflower, and her friend, a potato. Turns out we weren’t the only people who liked sunflowers and potatoes.
             </p>
             <p class="bio-p">From there we continued writing kids books, but we always wanted to try our hand at writing young adult/high fantasy adventures.
                After years of planning and outlining, we now have the Winter’s Bane series, which will span three books. This kind of writing takes endless hours, 
                patience, and sometimes people, but we couldn't be happier with the results. 
             </p>
             <p class="bio-p">My wife and I live in Denver Colorado. We have three beautiful kids, and anyone who is familiar with our work knows that family
                is at the heart of what we do. We love sticking family and friends into stories, and we hope they appreciate their written likeness. We hope 
                kids continue to enjoy all the fun that’s possible with a potato, and to readers of the Winter’s Bane Collection, Light of Terra guide you.
